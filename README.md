# Multilingual Hate Speech Detection Using Deep Learning Methods

The research started with collecting data from the YouTube, the most common video sharing platform by using certain
keywords and then data is pre-processed by converting videos into audio then transcripts and later transcripts are NLP
pre-processed. The feature engineering is then performed on the processed text by Tf-IDF vectorizer. Then the vectorsare trained by machine learning models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifier and then with H2O Deep
learning model and also H2O Deep Learning model with Hyperparameters as well. The research was able to achieve
0.95 accuracy with H2O Deep learning model with hyperparameters as well as F1 Score of 0.952.
